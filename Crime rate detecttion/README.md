#Crime Dataset Analysis and Regression Models

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the use of various regression models on a dataset related to crime. The models include KNeighbors Regressor (KNN), Lasso Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Ridge Regression.

### Overview
The script performs the following tasks:

### Importing Necessary Modules:
Importing essential libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, visualization, and model evaluation.

### Loading the Dataset:
Loading the dataset "CommViolPredUnnormalizedData.txt" using Pandas, selecting specific columns, and handling missing values.

### Preparing the Features and Target:
Extracting features (X) and the target variable (y) from the dataset.

### Model Training and Evaluation:
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

### Training and evaluating different regression models:
KNeighbors Regressor (KNN)
Lasso Regression
Polynomial Regression
Ridge Regression

###Printing Model Performance:
Displaying R-squared scores for the trained models.
The models are evaluated in terms of R-squared scores on both training and testing sets to assess their performance.
