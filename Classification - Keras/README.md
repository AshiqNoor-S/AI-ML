# Classification Models with Keras

This repository contains code that demonstrates the creation and training of a classification neural network model using the Keras library. The code uses the popular MNIST dataset of handwritten digits for training and testing purposes.

## Introduction

The primary objective of this project is to showcase the process of building, training, and evaluating a neural network for classification tasks using the Keras framework. The model is designed to classify images of handwritten digits into their respective numerical classes (0 to 9).

## Getting Started

To run the code, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including Keras, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib. You can install the required packages using the following command:


## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is employed for training and testing the classification model. It consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits, along with their corresponding labels.

## Code Overview

1. **Data Preparation**: The dataset is loaded using the Keras API, and the images are flattened into one-dimensional vectors. Pixel values are normalized to a range between 0 and 1. Labels are one-hot encoded using Keras utilities.

2. **Neural Network Architecture**: A classification model is defined using the Sequential model from Keras. The model consists of:
   - Input layer with neurons equal to the number of pixels in each image.
   - One hidden layer with 100 neurons and a ReLU activation function.
   - Output layer with neurons equal to the number of classes (digits 0 to 9) and a softmax activation function for classification probabilities.

3. **Model Compilation**: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function, suitable for multiclass classification. Accuracy is chosen as the evaluation metric.

4. **Model Training**: The model is trained using the training data, validated with the test data, and trained for a set number of epochs.

5. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset to measure its accuracy and error rate.

6. **Saving and Loading Model**: The trained model is saved to a `.h5` file using the `save()` method. To reuse the model, the `load_model()` function is utilized.

## Results

The code generates and trains a classification model to recognize handwritten digits. The achieved accuracy and error rate are displayed upon evaluation. Note that training times can vary based on computational resources.

## Usage

1. Install required dependencies: `pip install keras tensorflow matplotlib`
2. Run the code to load, preprocess, build, train, and evaluate the classification model.

## Considerations

- Experiment with hyperparameters like the number of neurons, hidden layers, and epochs for potential performance improvements.
- For more complex datasets, consider using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for better feature extraction.
