# Concrete Strength Prediction using Neural Networks

## Introduction
This repository contains code demonstrating the use of neural networks to predict the compressive strength of concrete samples based on various input features. The code utilizes the Keras library with a TensorFlow backend to build and train the neural network.

## Data Source
The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from a CSV file available at [Concrete Data](https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DL0101EN/labs/data/concrete_data.csv).

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing
The code employs the Pandas and NumPy libraries to read, explore, and preprocess the dataset. Missing values are checked and found to be absent, ensuring dataset quality.

## Data Splitting
The dataset is divided into predictor variables (input features) and the target variable (compressive strength). Predictor variables include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate.

## Normalization
Predictor variables are normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. This step ensures all features are on a similar scale.

## Neural Network Architecture
The neural network architecture is defined using the Keras library. The model consists of:
- An input layer with the same number of neurons as predictor variables.
- Two hidden layers, each containing 50 neurons and utilizing the ReLU activation function.
- An output layer with a single neuron (regression task).

## Model Compilation
The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and the mean squared error loss function, suitable for regression tasks.

## Model Training
The model is trained using the training data. During training, 30% of the data is set aside as a validation set to monitor performance. The model is trained for 100 epochs.

## Usage
1. Ensure required libraries are installed.
2. Run the code sequentially to load, preprocess, build, train, and evaluate the neural network model.

## Results
- The training process outputs loss and validation loss information at each epoch.
- After training, the model predicts concrete compressive strength based on input features.

## Considerations
- Efforts are made to prevent overfitting due to the relatively small dataset (~1000 samples).
- The neural network architecture and hyperparameters can be adjusted for experimentation.
