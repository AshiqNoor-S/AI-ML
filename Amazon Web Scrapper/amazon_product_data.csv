The watch is great , but i am highly dissapointed in using harsh words like ""AMAZON IS A CHEAT "" . THE WATCH IT SOLD ME IS AN OVERSEAS MODEL , WITH NO WARRANTY/ REPAIR IN INDIA .
                           
                           I RECETLY HAD SOME DISPLAY ISSUES SO WENT TO AN AUTHORISED SAMSUNG STORE WHERE I AM TOLD THAT THIS WATCH IS NEITHER SERVICEABLE NOR WOULD BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY HAD IT BEEN IN WARRANTY PERIOD ( POST 1 YEAR SO MY WARRANTY HAD LAPSED ) .AFTER AROUND A MONTH OF 10S OF HOUR LONG CALLS WITH THE AMAZON SERVICE TEAM , LAST REPLY I GOT WAS THAT WE CANT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT , AND THAT THIS IS THE HIGHEST ESCALATION TEAM I WAS TALKING TO AT AMAZON .
                           
                           I BOUGHT AN ICICI AMAZON CREDIT CARD AS I TRUSTED AMAZON BUT I AM DEEPLY SADDENED BY THE RESPONSE AND THE FACT THAT AMAZON IS OVERLOOKING A ""FRAUD"" , "" CHEATING "" DELIBERATELY .
                           
                           I WOULD NOT BE BUYING AS MUCH AS PEN FROM THIS WEBSITE AFTER BEING A LOYAL CUSTOMER WHO BOUGHT AC's ,microwaves watches and a lot of expensive stuff from them .

My honest opinion about this smartwatch after a month of use. I got this watch during the Big Billion Sale. I can assure it a great value for money if you buy it during the sale.
                           

                           The build quality is insanely good. The rotating dial on the top works seamlessly. Not to mention the leather straps are cozy and sweat free.
                           

                           The display size of this is 45 mm, am 6ft and it fits my rist fairly good. Depending on your watch faces the informations are legible and clear. No complains on the in built health applications, they all work precisely good.
                           

                           Like every reviewer said, the battery backup is fairly okay not great. I will go on using the watch for two straight days with full charge if I leave the always on display off.
                           

                           YES! You can recieve and make calls via the watch directly connected to your phone without the use of actual phone in hand. It comes with one catch!
                           

                           THE CATCH!
                           

                           Don't buy this watch if you want to pair it with an iPhone. The functions are way too limited that you will end up hating the watch. The Galaxy Wear app in app store does provide very limited configurations. And you cannot use the call functions of you are connected to an iPhone.
                           

                           I infact switched from my iphone 11 to Samsung Note 10 last month to experience the fullest potential of this watch.
                           

                           Works like super gadget if connected to a samsung smartphone. I believe the same with other Android devices.
                           

                           That's it from my end.
                           

                           Cheers!

This watch is completely Exceeded my expectations
                           
                           Pros
                           
                           1. Have a genuine BPM reader
                           
                           2. Many Customisations available
                           
                           3. Has many sport modes which actually is completely cool and if we are running,walking ,taking reps,situps etc it actually measures it
                           
                           Cons
                           
                           1. Doesn't have Google support
                           
                           2. Can't put/view video files
                           
                           3. Looks are good except for the strap it feels very cheap for a 16K watch
                           
                           4. It's charging speeds are very low
                           
                           5. Battery drains very fastly while listening music through BT headphones that's very irritating when it comes to a music listener
                           
                           And what's more irritating is low speed charging after listening
                           
                           6. Speakers are Ok but could have been tweaked / improved (Audio quality is Good)
                           
                           That's all ,its a worthy watch for its price can't deny the fact that it has some minor issues but still it's worth every penny

It's been slightly more over 4 months since i own this watch. Here are my feedback:
                           
                           Pros:
                           
                           Watch looks stunning and the circular dial around it just makes it really comfortable navigating
                           
                           Touch screen is extremely good. Very sensitive.
                           
                           Very sturdy. Had a couple of brushes against not so good surfaces and it sustained it without leaving any scratches. Feels premium
                           
                           Quite accurate tracking and detailed reports
                           
                           Display is the best I've seen so far. Just too good.
                           
                           Wireless charging but not sure if this was required as it comes with a downside
                           
                           Respond to notifications, connect to various apps and everything else is seamless
                           

                           Cons:
                           
                           They ship it only with a leather strap for a fitness tracking smart watch - you'll have to buy a new nylon or silicon strap as leather gets damaged against sweat
                           
                           No wear OS - the biggest turn off. You'll have to deal with things such as Bixby and other not so developed apps in case you need this premium feel
                           
                           Battery life is super bad. Drains out in a day and the charging is super slow takes more than 120 mins to fully charge back. Quite a deal if you wear this everyday like me
                           

                           Overall - if you are buying it for the long term and build quality without caring for a few less features this is the watch to go for.
                           

                           The alternatives are the Apple watch (extremely accurate with good haptic) for the similar price but you'll have to own an iPhone.
